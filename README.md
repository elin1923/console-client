Free Bee
========
Free Bee is a free clone of The New York Times game Spelling Bee.

It is played exactly the same way.
The only notable differences are the use of the SOWPODS dictionary instead
of the NYT dictionary, and no score levels. Patches welcome.

This is a very quickly made prototype for the terminal. Patches welcome.

There are plans to make this into a full-fledged desktop and web application.

Compiling
---------
Just run `make`. I'm using some OpenBSD extensions, so Linux people might
need to add `libbsd` as needed.
