Free Bee
========
Free Bee is a free clone of The New York Times game Spelling Bee.

It is played exactly the same way.
The only notable difference is the use of the SOWPODS dictionary instead of
the NYT dictionary. Patches welcome.

This is a very quickly made prototype for the terminal. Patches welcome.

There are plans to make this into a full-fledged desktop and web application.

Compiling
---------
Just run `make`. I'm using some OpenBSD extensions, so Linux people might
need to add `libbsd` as needed.
