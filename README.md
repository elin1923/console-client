Free Bee
========
Free Bee is a free clone of The New York Times game Spelling Bee.

In this game, your goal is to find as many words as you can with the seven
letters you are given. Letters can be used more than once in a word. Finding
a word that uses all seven letters yields bonus points! Every game has at
least one such word, and many games have multiple. As you earn points, you
rise through the ranks of the hive, ultimately becoming the Queen Bee.

The only notable difference between Free Bee and the origina game is the use
 of the SOWPODS dictionary instead of the NYT dictionary. Patches welcome.

This is a very quickly made prototype for the terminal. Patches welcome.

There are plans to make this into a full-fledged desktop and web application.

Compiling
---------
Just run `make`. I'm using some OpenBSD extensions, so Linux people might
need to add `libbsd` as needed.
